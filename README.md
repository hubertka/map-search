This project was created to learn how to build a location reminders section for the previous Reminders app (link). The first step was to learn how to use iOS's MapKit to display a map view, enable search for locations, adding an annotation of a selected location search item, and to use the annotation's callout to link to another action. This project will be encapsulated into the Reminders app project as part of the "Remind me at location" feature.
